* Emacs config
** Use Package
   The use-package macro is something that I'd like to be able to
   employ here, but I need to go about it in the right way.
** Evil mode
   Since I'm used to vim-style keybindings, I think that I just need
   to keep using them.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'evil)
(require 'evil-escape)
(evil-mode 1)
(evil-escape-mode)
#+END_SRC
** Org mode
   Obviously I need to use org-mode, day-to-day and otherwise.
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'org)
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
#+END_SRC
** Convenience
   Ivy mode and others
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(ivy-mode 1)
(setq ivy-use-virtual-buffers t)
(setq ivy-count-format "(%d/%d) ")
(which-key-mode 1)
#+END_SRC
